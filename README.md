Many years ago , while studing Linear Programming course in Tel Aviv University (Operation research studies),
i had an idea to develop some instrument/application that will build a work shcedule authomaticly and also 
will maximize the solution (by giving the most prefered shifts to employees). 

Now as a Junior Full Stack developer, i try to create it as a full stack application (Node+mongoDB+React). 

This part is a Backend part of the whole project.
